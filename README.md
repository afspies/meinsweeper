MeinSweeper is a light-weight framework for running experiments on arbitrary compute nodes

```diff
- This is still in alpha, and was written for research
- I.e. expect bugs and smelly code!
```

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install meinsweeper
```

## Usage
### Using Provided Node-types
```python
import meinsweeper

cfg = {'target': 'ssh', ...}

meinsweeper.run(cfg)
```


### With Custom Nodes
#### Subclass and existing node
Override the initialization, running or logging behaviour of an existing node type.
If you would like to establish a generic, and robust, communication class which systematically utilizes STDOUT, that would be nice ;).

#### Create a node class
```python
class MyNode(Node):


```

Specify new target as pascal_case version of class name 

```python

cfg = {'target':'my_node', ....}

meinsweeper.run(cfg)

```
